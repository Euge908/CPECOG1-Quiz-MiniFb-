First Commit Still Buggy. 

See https://github.com/tchapi/markdown-cheatsheet/blob/master/README.md for editing README files.

## Issues to be Addressed:
* Levels are not yet implemented (I'm currently implementing a test level to see if all the components work)
* Dying by falling does not work
* Coin positioning is buggy
* Coin collection does not work
* Power Ups not yet added (not sure if we'll continue with this)
* Ball cannot collect coin
* Score count does not work
* Pause does not work
* Panning still glitchy
* SaveGlass Not working
* Enemies not yet initialized

## Issues Addressed:
* Collision and gravity now works
* User control of ball
